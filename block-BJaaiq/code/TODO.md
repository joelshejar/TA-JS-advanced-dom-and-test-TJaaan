## Quotes on scroll

- Create a infinite scroll quote page using the `scroll` type of event listener
- There is a file in this folder named `quotes.js` use it as a data source
- In the starting it will display only 3 quotes
- As soon as you start scrolling it will keep adding new quotes at the bottom
- When you are displaying the quotes don't forget to add the author name also
- Using the lifecycle events like `DOMContentLoaded` display a alert message saying the `The content of the DOM is loaded`
- You can use the image given below for help to understand.
