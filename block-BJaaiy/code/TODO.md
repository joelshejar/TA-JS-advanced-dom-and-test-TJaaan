## Using node and NPM

- Create a folder and initialize it with NPM
- Add a package named `parcel-bundler`
- Create a live server
- Use the `moment` library (https://momentjs.com/)
- Also use the `lodash` library

#### Use the following links to read documentation

- [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)

#### Use moment to do the following things:

Print Date or Time in the following format:

- `February 12th 2021, 12:54:12 pm`
- `Friday`
- `Feb 12th 21`

Check if the following date is valid or not:

- `2020-01-01`
- `2020-14-01`

Manipulating Dates

- adds 7 days to current date
- adds 7 months to current date
- adds 7 years to current date

- subtracts 7 days to current date
- subtracts 7 months to current date
- subtracts 7 years to current date

Find the difference between the following 2 dates:

1.

- date1: `2014-11-11`
- date2: `2015-09-11`

2.

- date1: `2014-11-27`
- date2: `2015-09-16`

- Check is `2020-01-01` date after `2018-01-01`
- Check is `2010-01-01` date after `2018-01-01`
- Check if the year `2019` is a leap year
- Check if the year `2020` is a leap year

#### Use lodash to do the following things:

- Use five methods form the list of Array methods and five from Collection methods (Left side on this link https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)
