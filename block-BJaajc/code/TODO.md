# Writing Test Using Jest

Write the function in `index.js` file and also write the test in `index.test.js` file for the following functions. While writing test make sure you write at-least 3 positive and 3 negative test.

- Positive Test verifies expected behavior with valid data.
- Negative Test verifies expected behavior with invalid data.
- Edge Case is a subset of positive tests, which checks the extreme edges of valid values.

1. Write a function named `getFullName` that accepts two input `firstName` and `lastName` and return the `fullName`

2. Write a function named `isPalindrome` that accepts one input returns `true` or `false` based on wether the value passed is palindrome or not.

3. Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

- Create a function called `getCircumfrence`:

Pass the radius of a circle to the function and it returns the circumference based on the radius, and output `The circumference is NN`.

- Create a function called `getArea`:

Pass the radius to the function and it returns the area based on the radius, and output `The area is NN`.
